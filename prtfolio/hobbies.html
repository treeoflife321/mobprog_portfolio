    <p>You may notice that at the side bar, its all games. That's because I find them much more entertaining than the usual play basketball, cooking, visiting other places kinds of hobby.</p>
    <p>A hobby is supposed to be an activity, interest, or pastime that is undertaken for pleasure or relaxation, done during one's own leisure time. Almost all of my hobbies are a bit competetive to be exact and for me its just the right thing to do when one is doing nothing.</p>

    <p>Though it is true that I dont play many games. Even my list can't get through five items. But I am always open to any game that catches my fancy. But as of making this project I don't have much time to play any of the above mentioned games because of the busy schedule that is college. Hopefully to update the list and experience more games in the near future!</p>
