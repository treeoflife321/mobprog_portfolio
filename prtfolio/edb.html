	<h1>Jasaan Central School</h1>
	<p>I attended and graduated my primary education in a public school called Jasaan Central School. I was part of the Special Science Class program of the school which grouped me with other children their system believed to perform better than regular classes in the school.</p>

	<h1>Saint Mary's Academy of Jasaan</h1>
	<p>I attended and graduated my secondary education in a private school called Saint Mary's Academy of Jasaan. The school was a religous institution teaching students an extra subject about "Christian Living". It may sound something special but it's just another subject for you to pass to be honest. Just like any other schools they had some events dedicated to thier religion and the masses were so many. But all in all its normal.</p>

	<h1>Capitol University</h1>
	<p>I attended and graduated my senior high school at Capitol University. The experience of going to the city to study was a very new experience to me. It was not really easy at first because being in a university made me feel small in a sense that I am in between so many people from different places. Adjusting took a whole semester but after the change easily adapted so it wasn't so bad. The immersion subject was a lot of help because I got to experience working like an adult or even a small bite on how they do it even for a short time. Though I didn't get the chance to wear a graduation gown because of COVID.</p>
